Hello, world! My name is Saptam. My research interest broadly falls under the umbrella of sequential decision-making. More precisely, my interest lies in Reinforcement Learning where we try to make autonomous agents learn by interacting with the environment. Quiet recently, I came to know about Offline Reinforcement Learning and immediately fell in love with it. I still find it pretty astounding that an agent can learn from data and be better than the original agent who generated it.

That said, I find several closely related (and some not so-closely related) fields interesting including (but not limited to) Multi-armed Bandits, (Statistical) Learning Theory, and Variational Inference.
